== React.js Comment Tutorial with Ruby on Rails 4

This is based off the React.js comment tutorial at https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html

I added a few changes like the timestamp and the order of the comments being descending.

What's being used:

* React.js

* Ruby on Rails 4

* react-rails

* Moment.js
